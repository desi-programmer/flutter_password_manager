    - Not for web
    - You can easily add Custom Backend

# Security Layers
    1. Your password String is Encrypted itself.
    2. The Entire Database is encrypted.
    3. Uses Your Phone's Local Bio (Fingerprint) auth.
        - Also it is single-time Allow only, 
        which means if you press home or back, You will have to re-authenticate.
